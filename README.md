# CountingBot
A discord bot that hosts binary counting games.

How to use:
1. Ask me for an invite link
2. Say "binary count here" in the channel you want the game to be hosted in.
3. -Members of the server must take turns counting in binary.
   -A single member cannot count twice in a row.
   -When a count is successful then the bot reacts to your message with a green check mark.  When a count is unsuccessful then the bot reacts to your message with an "X" and a game over message; someone then must start counting again from 1.
   -The bot ignores any message that isn't strictly an integer.
